Hey Nicholas! I know you probably get a lot of messages, so no worries if you don’t get to this at all, but I just wanted to say that I really appreciate your energy and communication with the interns. The way you organize everything makes it feel more connected than even the in-person internships I’ve done, which really enhances the experience. Just wanted to let you know that because I truly appreciate it!
